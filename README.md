# Single Tier Farms
Mod for Eco 9.5 that puts an end to multi-tiered farms by preventing sowing seeds when there are any dirt blocks above it.
Currently the seedlings are destroyed as soon as they are planted rather than preventing the sowing action outright.
Works with both plant and tree seeds, as well as with steam tractors.

# Installation
Drop the 'Single Tier Farms' folder into Mods/UserCode

# Known Issues
Seeds are still consumed when planting on a covered block
